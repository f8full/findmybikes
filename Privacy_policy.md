### This section applies to all versions of Android
# #findmybikes does not collect nor use any personal information.

**A note on identifiable information : By itself, a station name (the default name for a new favorite) doesn't say anything about you.
But if you rename one of your favorite, let's say 'Home',
then the information becomes identifiable as it carries meaning that reveals a personal information.**

for each bike networks you've used #findmybikes with. NON IDENTIFIABLE
- A **collection of character strings** (text), corresponding to the personalized name, if any, you gave to each individual favorite in your most recent favorites
list for each bike networks you've used the #findmybikes with. POTENTIALLY IDENTIFIABLE (not with default favorites names).

The only use of this data is to restore your favorites after a factory reset or upgrade to a new phone (favorites restoration). This policy makes you aware that Google maintains this data outside of reach
of #findmybikes developer. Google routinely respond to well formed legal requests. You can consult Google's transparency report at
