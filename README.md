##### note
As stated in the [privacy policy], no personal data is neither collected nor used by #findmybikes.
However, some non personal and non identifiable data is collected and published publicly on Twitter.
You can see the data output on the dedicated bot timeline
#### https://twitter.com/findmybikesdata
This published data is the essence of the ludOScity initiative : make cities smarter through clever interactions
with their inhabitants. This data could be used by your bike service provider to improve the service.
Anyone else, including you, could come up with some idea to use it.


#### Twitter output data format specification

Data is tweeted **when the station closest to you doesn't provide service**. When that happen, #ludOS publishes
a status update through [@findmybikesdata]. This tweet mentions what was the closest station **that could provide you service**.

    #findmybixibikes bike is not closest! Bikes:X BAD at IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDID ~XXmin walk stationnamestationnamestation deduplicateZ

If some stations were discarded in the selection process (because they'd be closer but could not provide service either)
Tweet replies are generated, providing more details on discarded stations

All status updates (root or replies) are geotagged with the location of the described station.
