##### note
As stated in the [privacy policy], no personal data is neither collected nor used by #findmybikes.
However, some non personal and non identifiable data is collected and published publicly on Twitter.
You can see the data output on the dedicated bot timeline
#### https://twitter.com/findmybikesdata
This published data is the essence of #ludOScity : smarter cities through smart interactions
with their inhabitants. This data could be used to visualize and/or evaluate bikeshare services.
Anyone, including you, could come up with some idea to use it.


#### Twitter output data format specification

Data is tweeted **when the station closest to you doesn't provide service**. When that happen, #ludOS publishes
a status update through [@findmybikesdata]. This tweet mentions what was the closest station **that could provide you service**.

    #findmybixibikes bike is not closest! Bikes:X BAD at IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDID ~XXmin walk stationnamestationnamestation deduplicateZ
sample *#findmybixibikes bike is not closest! Bikes:7 BAD at f132843c3c740cce6760167985bc4d17 ~2min walk Br√©beuf / Laurier deduplicate0*

If some stations were discarded in the selection process (because they'd be closer but could not provide service either)
Tweet replies are generated, providing more details on discarded stations

    #findmybixibikes discarded closer! Bikes:Y CRI at IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDID stationnamestationnamestationnamestationnamestationnam
sample *#findmyvlovbikes discarded closer! Bikes:0 CRI at 962c34a494d29737aa7c534f85566949 10102 - DOUA / G. BERGER*

All status updates (root or replies) are geotagged with the location of the described station.

Station names are provided for readability. Station id is provided by citibik.es API
